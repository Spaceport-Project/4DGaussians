## Render Process script

This script aims that after rendering with nerfstudio, blending rendered png images to static background image.

render_output_images_path represents folder path that has **images to be blended**
Currently, only one background image supported which is  represents by **bg_image**
output_path is the desired path to blended images location.


After changing those variables above, `python render_process.py` is enough.
